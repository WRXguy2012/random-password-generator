##How It Works

## How to use
The random-password-generator is simple to use. The user just clicks on the get password icon. From there, a list of prompts will pop up on the screen so the user can choose the perameters of the password given. Finally, the generated password is displayed on the application.

## User-Defined Perameters
THe user can select the legnth (between 8 and 128 characters) and has an option to use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbrs and even all OWASP approved special characters.
